#My Project 1

##This is a game for 2 or 4 players

For a 2 player version of the game, you can have player 1 assume the roles players 1 and 3, and player 2 will assume the roles of players 2 and 4. The objective will then be to be the first player to get either one of your colours to connect 3.

5 x 5 grid win conditions
3 for every one row for 5 rows = 15

3 (triangle number) from two different diagonals going in 2 directions above the mid diagonal = 6
